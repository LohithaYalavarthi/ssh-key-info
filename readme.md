To create SSH key We can either use RSA or id_25519 Encryption but rsa is safe

Create SSH key using rsa

ssh-key-gen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "lohiyalavarthi95@gmail.com"

Now the key generated we need to let ssh agent know about our key and store it to this

SSh-agent is mostly like wallet where it stores ssh keys

To run ssh-agent we need to do

eval "$(ssh-agent -S) - This is not working in gitbash

To run in git bash

eval ssh-agent

Need to add ssh-agent now using

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~- Simply mean C:/users/lohit

Try to login to github acccount and settings -> SSH KEYS and try to create new ssh key and copy the ssh key id_rsa.pub that we generated in our system to github account

to read id_rsa.pub in our file, we have to do cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa this will output contents in the file id_rsa.pub and we can copy that content and paste in github new sshkey field

Try to test it now by doing

ssh -T git@github.com

Basically the above command tells that we are going to use ssh key to access github.com

if we want to clone from the github all we can do is just use git clone git@github.com:LohithaYalavarthi/Hooks-Concepts.git
